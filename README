App: Write a simple RSS reader web app
Requirements:
- users sign up using an email address
- users can add/remove feeds
- users can read feeds directly in the app
- the reader keeps track of which items a user has read

TODO:
- Verify a users email address, require password/open id
- Separate sign-in and user registration 
- Allow a user to explicitly mark an item as read or unread
- Use a cookie to store login credentials
- Allow a user to change email address
- Add proper admin functionality (currently hackable by guessing URLs)
- Check publication date of feed before reading all items
- If one user edits a feed url, create a new RssFeed record if any other users are subscribed to that feed
- Sort feed by date
- Cleanup unnecessary code from rails automatic code generation
- Check lots of different feeds to be sure they render reasonably
